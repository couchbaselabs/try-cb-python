# Couchbase Python travel-sample Application REST Backend

This is a sample application for getting started with [Couchbase Server] and the [Python SDK].
The application runs a single page web UI for demonstrating SQL for Documents (N1QL), Sub-document requests and Full Text Search (FTS) querying capabilities.
It uses Couchbase Server together with the [Flask] web framework for [Python], [Swagger] for API documentation, [Vue] and [Bootstrap].

The application is a flight planner that allows the user to search for and select a flight route (including the return flight) based on airports and dates.
Airport selection is done dynamically using an autocomplete box bound to N1QL queries on the server side. After selecting a date, it then searches
for applicable air flight routes from a previously populated database. An additional page allows users to search for Hotels using less structured keywords.

## Prerequisites

To download the application you can either download [the archive](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python.git
```

We recommend running the application with Docker, which starts up all components for you, but you can also run it in a Mix-and-Match style, which we'll decribe below.

## Running the application with Docker

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine in order to run this application as we have defined a [_Dockerfile_](Dockerfile) and a [_docker-compose.yml_](docker-compose.yml) to run Couchbase Server 7.0.0, the frontend [Vue app](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-frontend-v2.git) and the Python REST API.

To launch the full application you can simply run this command from a terminal:

```
docker-compose up
```
> **_NOTE:_** You may need more than the default RAM to run the images.
We have tested the travel-sample apps with 4.5 GB RAM configured in Docker's Preferences... -> Resources -> Memory.
When you run the application for the first time, it will pull/build the relevant docker images, so it might take a bit of time.

This will start the Python backend, Couchbase Server 7.0.0 and the Vue frontend app.

You can access the backend API on `http://localhost:8080/`, the UI on `http://localhost:8081/` and Couchbase Server at `http://localhost:8091/`.

```

You should then be able to browse the UI, search for US airports and get flight route information.

In order to make changes in the Python API and familiarize yourself with the SDK, you can update the `travel.py` file and save it. This will reload the backend server almost instantly.

To end the application press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal and wait for docker-compose to gracefully stop your containers.

## Mix and match services

Instead of running all services, you can start any combination of `backend`,`frontend`, `db` via docker, and take responsibility for starting the other services yourself.

As the provided `docker-compose.yml` sets up dependencies between the services, to make startup as smooth and automatic as possible, we also provide an alternative `mix-and-match.yml`.  We'll look at a few useful scenarios here.

### Bring your own database
If you wish to run this application against your own configuration of Couchbase Server, you will need version 7.0.0 or later with the `travel-sample` bucket setup.

> **_NOTE:_** If you are not using Docker to start up the Database, or the provided wrapper wait-for-couchbase.sh, you will need to create a full text search index on travel-sample bucket called 'hotels-index'. You can do this via the following command:

```
curl --fail -s -u <username>:<password> -X PUT \
        http://<host>:8094/api/index/hotels-index \
        -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
        -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        -d @fts-hotels-index.json
```

With a running Couchbase Server, you can pass the database details in:

```
CB_HOST=10.144.211.101 CB_USER=Administrator CB_PSWD=password docker-compose -f mix-and-match.yml up backend frontend
```

The Docker image will run the same checks as usual, and also create the hotels-index if it does not already exist.

### Running the backend manually

If you want to run the Python API yourself without using Docker, you will need to ensure that you have `Python 3.7` or higher installed on your machine. You may still use Docker to run the Database and Frontend components if desired.

Install the dependencies:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The first time you run against a new database image, you may want to use the provided
`wait-for-couchbase.sh` wrapper to ensure that all indexes are created.

For example, using the Docker image provided:

```
docker-compose -f mix-and-match.yml up db
export CB_HOST=localhost
./wait-for-couchbase.sh echo Couchbase is ready!
python3 travel.py -c localhost -u Administrator -p password
```

If you already have an existing Couchbase server running and correctly configured, you might run:

```
python3 travel.py -c 10.144.211.101 -u Administrator -p password
```

Finally, if you want to see how the sample frontend Vue application works with your changes,
run it with:

```
docker-compose -f mix-and-match.yml up frontend
```

### Running the frontend manually

To run the frontend components manually without Docker, follow the guide
[here](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-frontend-v2)


## REST API reference, and tests.

All the travel-sample apps conform to the same interface, which means that they can all be used with the same database configuration and Vue.js frontend.

We've integrated Swagger/OpenApi version 3 documentation which can be accessed on the backend at `http://localhost:8080/apidocs` once you have started the app.

(You can also view a read-only version at https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/hello-world/sample-application.html#)

To further ensure that every app conforms to the API, we have a [test suite][try-cb-test], which you can simply run with the command:

```
docker-compose --profile test up test
```

Best practice for running tests mix-and-match style are WIP. Something like the following might work on Mac:

```
BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8080 docker-compose -f mix-and-match.yml up test
```

Check the test repo for details on how to run locally.
